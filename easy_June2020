Difficulty: Easy (do all high frequencies, and CASE, SET, UPDATE, INSERT ones)

Need to redo: 
597, 603 

597:
SELECT ROUND(IFNULL((SELECT COUNT(*) 
                     FROM (SELECT DISTINCT requester_id, accepter_id 
                           FROM request_accepted) AS A)/

                            FROM friend_request) AS B), 0), 2) AS accept_rate;

607 (easy - done but do again),
1083 (easy - done but do again), 1142 (easy - COUNT(DISTINCT session_id)/COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) - done 1x), 
1280 (weird 3-way join table),
1435 (weird one), 1484 (easy -> do again for GROUP_CONCAT)
1076 (window function - relatively easy) -> redo again
1303 (window function - easy) -> redo again

Notes:
-- Double check the JOIN tables to ensure it is what you need. That is very important 
-- Have to thoroughly think through the case to ensure it yields the correct answer during exam
-- MAX(num) takes care of NULL. SELECT MAX(NULL) gives you NULL
-- WHERE __ IN (subquery) - this subquery does not need to add a subquery name
-- FROM (subquery) - this subquery needs a subquery name
-- GROUP BY x, y - does not need parenthesis
-- WHERE (x, y) - needs parenthesis
-- UPDATE table_name, SET sex = IF ( )
-- ROUND(AVG(experience_years), 2) with GROUP BY project_id -> GROUP BY affects the AVG denominator count
-- 1484. GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product ORDER BY product ASC SEPARATOR ',') AS products
-- 1142. COUNT(DISTINCT session_id)/COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)

48 questions so far => half way point is 1069 - Product Sales Analysis II

C*175 - Combine Two Tables -> done 1x
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT FirstName, LastName, City, State
FROM Person LEFT JOIN Address USING (PersonId);

A,C*176 - Second Highest Salary -> done 1x
- DID NOT FLASH => OFFSET excludes the first set of records
- HAS TO BE LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1 (cannot do OFFSET 1 LIMIT 1)
=> IFNULL(expression1, expression2) => IFNULL returns expression1 if expression1 is NOT NULL, otherwise it returns expression2

This answer gives you NULL (correct answer) => is expression1 NULL? If not, return expression1. If it is NULL, return NULL.
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT IFNULL(
(SELECT DISTINCT Salary
FROM Employee
ORDER BY Salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1), NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary;

This subquery: 
(SELECT DISTINCT Salary
FROM Employee
ORDER BY Salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1) gives you the 200 already

This answer DOES NOT give you the NULL
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT DISTINCT Salary AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
ORDER BY Salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;

This answer gets you the correct result, but the wrong thinking:
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT MAX(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
WHERE Salary < (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee);

A,C*181 - Employees Earning More Than Their Managers -> done 1X 
=> Have to draw it out on pen and paper
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT e1.Name AS Employee
FROM Employee e1 JOIN Employee e2 ON e1.ManagerId = e2.Id
WHERE e1.salary > e2.salary;

C*182. Duplicate Emails - FLASHED - done 1x
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT Email
FROM Person
GROUP BY Email
HAVING COUNT(Email) > 1;

A,C*183. Customer Who Never Order -> done 1x
--> ORDER BY Name ASC; -> means A is on top, Z is on bottom. ASCII code for A is smaller than Z.
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT Name AS Customers
FROM Customers
WHERE Customers.Id NOT IN (SELECT CustomerId FROM Orders);

A,C*196. Delete Duplicate Emails - done 1x
=> DID NOT FLASH (need a self-join for this question: FROM table1 T1, table1 T2), DELETE p1.*
# Write your MySQL query statement below
DELETE p1.*
FROM Person p1, Person p2
WHERE p1.Email = p2.Email AND p1.Id > p2.Id;

C*197. Rising Temperature - done 1x
=> DID NOT FLASH (DATEDIFF function) - DATE DIFF
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT w1.Id AS Id
FROM Weather w1 JOIN Weather w2
WHERE w1.Temperature > w2.Temperature AND DATEDIFF(w1.RecordDate, w2.RecordDate) = 1;

*511. Game Play Analysis I -> done 1x
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS first_login
FROM Activity
GROUP BY player_id;

*512. Game Play Analysis II - did 1x
*DID NOT FLASH => Think about what you need/ what you are getting from your subquery first
*WHERE () - needs parentheses

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT player_id, device_id
FROM Activity
WHERE (player_id, event_date) IN (SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) FROM Activity GROUP BY player_id);

*577. Employee Bonus - done 1x
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT name, bonus

WHERE bonus < 1000 OR bonus IS NULL;

C*584. Find Customer Referee - done 1x
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT name
FROM customer 
WHERE referee_id != 2 OR referee_id IS NULL;

A*586. Customer Placing the Largest Number of Orders - done 1x 
=> DID NOT FLASH IMPORTANT*: Have to aggregate (via GROUP BY) data first, then ORDER BY COUNT(*) 
=> COUNT returns "before aggregation COUNT" even after GROUP BY
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT customer_number
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_number
ORDER BY COUNT(customer_number) DESC
LIMIT 1;

*595. Big Countries
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT name, population, area
FROM World 
WHERE area > 3000000 OR population > 25000000;

*596. Classes More Than 5 Students - done 1x

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT class
FROM courses
GROUP BY class
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT student) >= 5;

C,S*597. Friend Requests I: Overall Acceptance Rate -> NEED TO REDO
-- distinct number of accepted request from request_accepted / distinct number of requests from friend_request

SELECT
ROUND(
IFNULL(
-- numerator 
(SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT requester_id, accepter_id
      FROM request_accepted) AS a)
/     
-- denominator
(SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT sender_id, send_to_id
      FROM friend_request) AS b),
0), 2) AS accept_rate;


i) To get distinct number of accepted request from request_accepted table:
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT requester_id, accepter_id
      FROM request_accepted)
      
ii) To get distinct number of requests from friend_request table:
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT sender_id, send_to_id
      FROM friend_request); 
      
- Divide i) / ii), and ROUND ( ,2) 
- need IFNULL, as the divisor can be 0 -> need it to deal with the special case

C,W*603. Consecutive Available Seats - can use Window Function -> NEED TO REDO

JOIN and ABS():
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT DISTINCT c1.seat_id
FROM cinema c1 JOIN cinema c2

ON ABS(c1.seat_id - c2.seat_id) = 1
-- and seats have to be free
AND c1.free = TRUE AND c2.free = TRUE
ORDER BY c1.seat_id ASC; 

Window function:
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT seat_id
FROM (SELECT seat_id, free,

SELECT MIN(ABS(p1.x - p2.x)) AS shortest
FROM point p1 join point p2
WHERE p1.x != p2.x;

*619. Biggest Single Number -> done 1x
-- The subquery gives you the list of nums with COUNT of only 1. The outter query, selects the MAX num from that list.
-- MAX(num) takes care of NULL. SELECT MAX(NULL) gives you NULL
-- WHERE __ IN (subquery) - this subquery does not need to add a subquery name
-- FROM (subquery) - this subquery needs a subquery name
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT MAX(num) as num

              FROM my_numbers
              GROUP BY num
              HAVING COUNT(num) = 1);

*620. Not Boring Movies - FLASHED (look at the questions carefully and see is there any ORDER BY)
=> modulo is fine, != to replace <> is fine
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT id, movie, description, rating
FROM cinema
WHERE id%2 != 0 AND description !='boring'
ORDER BY rating DESC;

*627. Swap Salary -> FLASHED

FROM ActorDirector
GROUP BY actor_id, director_id

FROM Product JOIN Sales USING (product_id)
GROUP BY product_id
ORDER BY product_id ASC;

*1075. Project Employees I
# essentially: AVG(experience_years) = SUM(experience_years) / denominator  => denominator is COUNT(project_id) because it is GROUP BY project_id
# think of AVG as SUM(numerator/input) / DENOMINATOR => DENOMINATOR = COUNT (group by column)
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT project_id, ROUND(AVG(experience_years), 2) AS average_years
FROM Project JOIN Employee USING (employee_id)
GROUP BY project_id;

W**1076. Project Employees II => REDO
=> DID NOT FLASH - WINDOW FUNCTION => need to review carefully
=> trick: ORDER BY COUNT(DISTINCT employee_id) 
# Write your MySQL query statement below

A*1084. Sales Analysis III -- this is a weird question.... skip 

*1113. Reported Posts -> NEED TO REDO. GROUP BY extra. Then COUNT (DISTINCT post_id) WITHIN the aggregated extra.
-> Within aggregated extra, there is 1 DISTINCT post_id for spam, and 2 DISTINCT post_id for racism
=> DID NOT FLASH => DISTINCT does not need () 
=> WHERE goes before GROUP BY
=> HAVING is for filtering aggregate function

WHERE S1.parent_id IS NULL   
GROUP BY S1.sub_id;

*1251. Average Selling Price - redo
=> Need WHERE purchase_date BETWEEN start_date AND end_date to make sure the correct SUM(units * price) pairing is used!!

1378. Replace Employee ID with The Unique Identifier
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT unique_id, name
FROM EmployeeUNI RIGHT JOIN Employees USING (id);

*1407. Top Travellers 
=> LEFT JOIN to get NULL, IFNULL( , 0)
=> The IFNULL( ) fx takes two arguments. 
If the first argument is not NULL, the function returns the first argument. 
Otherwise, the second argument is returned. 
This function is commonly used to REPLACE NULL value with another value (second value).

# Write your MySQL query statement below

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT sell_date, COUNT(DISTINCT product) AS num_sold, 
GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product ORDER BY product ASC SEPARATOR ',') AS products
