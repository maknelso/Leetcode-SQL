midway point: 24th question: 1132 - Reported Posts II

Redo: 177, 184, 534, 550, 574, 1077, 1098 (a little bit difficult, need to look at the tables), 1107, 1126, 1445
Memorize: 177 (CREATE FUNCTION) -> CREATE, BEGIN, DECLARE, SET1, SET2, SET3,... RETURN

Notes:
-- writing pseudocode helps
-- 184. RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY 1ST ORDER BY 2ND) => 184. RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY DepartmentId ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS num
-- 184. have to RANK OVER(PARTITION BY DepartmentId), then DepartmentId next line -> otherwise error
-- 184. likely if you PARTITION BY DepartmentId, then DepartmentId must come AFTER
-- 534. SUM(games_played) OVER(PARTITION BY player_id ORDER BY event_date) AS games_played_so_far => SUM() OVER(PARTITION BY player_id ORDER BY event_date)
-> SUMS up game_played, segregated by player_id, segregated by the order of event_date
-- 570. To do COUNT(), you need GROUP BY. GROUP BY ManagerId, HAVING COUNT(ManagerId) >= 5 -> usually COUNT comes with GROUP BY
-- 574. Winning Candidate => If you want to COUNT, you need to GROUP BY usually
-- 574. RANK and COUNT does not seem to work well
-- 574. JOIN ON and JOIN WHERE combos are very similar. JOIN ON with LEFT JOIN will produce NULLs, JOIN WHERE combo with LEFT JOIN will not produce nulls.
-- 608. If subquery returns more than 1 line, you need IN (otherwise if it returns just 1 line, you can use = )
-- 614. WHERE and HAVING are very similar for a non-aggregate function. If you put before GROUP BY, use WHERE. If you put AFTER GROUP BY, use HAVING.
-- 1045. If you cannot segregate the product_key, use COUNT(DISTINCT product_key) to compare both tables
-- 1077. RANK() seems to have to be empty
-- 1077. Better to PARTITION BY if you know it works... if you GROUP BY you may lose the tie in the RANK()
-- 1421. => USING(column1, column2) => FROM Queries LEFT JOIN NPV USING(id, year);

A*177. Nth Highest Salary -> CREATE FUNCTION    -> easy
                             BEGIN
                                DECLARE
                                SET
                                SET
                                RETURN
                             END                  -> looks like SELECT DISTINCT Salary returns NULL
# Write your MySQL query statement below
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(n INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
  DECLARE offsetvariable INT;
  SET offsetvariable = n - 1;
  RETURN (SELECT DISTINCT Salary 
          FROM Employee
          ORDER BY Salary DESC
          LIMIT 1 OFFSET offsetvariable);
END
#algorithm: n as input = 2
#SELECT DISTINCT Salary
#FROM Employee
#ORDER BY Salary DESC
#LIMIT 1 OFFSET (how many?)
#->if we want to get 2nd highest salary, offset 1
#->if we want 3rd highest salary, offset 2
#->set offset variable to be (n - 1)

A, W*178. Rank Scores -> easy
# Write your MySQL query statement below
# DENSE_RANK window function for no gaps
SELECT score,
DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY Score DESC) AS 'Rank'
FROM Scores
ORDER BY score DESC;

A*180. Consecutive Numbers -> easy
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
-- Consecutive means ID of Num are next to each other.
-- Use 3 aliases for this table Logs and then check whether 3 consecutive numbers are all the same
-- Check Ids are consecutive
-- Check Num from all 3 Logs l1, l2, l3 are the same
SELECT DISTINCT l1.Num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs l1, Logs l2, Logs l3
WHERE l1.Id = l2.Id - 1 AND l2.Id = l3.Id - 1
AND l1.Num = l2.Num AND l2.Num = l3.num;

A*184. Department Highest Salary -> Window function -> a bit harder
=> have to RANK OVER(PARTITION BY DepartmentId), then DepartmentId next line -> otherwise error
=> likely if you PARTITION BY DepartmentId, then DepartmentId must come AFTER

-- Window function
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT Department.Name AS Department, Esub.Name AS Employee, Esub.Salary
FROM
(SELECT Id, Name, Salary, DepartmentId,
RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY DepartmentId ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS r
FROM Employee) AS Esub
JOIN Department ON Esub.DepartmentId = Department.Id
WHERE Esub.r = 1

-- Non-Window function
# Write your MySQL query statement below
-- IN subquery
SELECT Department.name AS 'Department', Employee.name AS 'Employee', Salary
FROM Employee JOIN Department ON Employee.DepartmentId = Department.Id
WHERE (Employee.DepartmentId, Salary) IN 
(SELECT DepartmentId, MAX(Salary)
 FROM Employee 
 GROUP BY DepartmentId);

534. Game Play Analysis III - did not flash
#Window function answer
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT player_id, event_date, SUM(games_played) OVER(PARTITION BY player_id ORDER BY event_date) AS games_played_so_far
FROM Activity
ORDER BY player_id, event_date ASC;

#Non-window function answer -> don't fully get...
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT a1.player_id, a1.event_date, SUM(a2.games_played) AS games_played_so_far
FROM activity a1, activity a2
WHERE a1.player_id = a2.player_id
AND a1.event_date >= a2.event_date
GROUP BY a1.player_id, a1.event_date
ORDER BY a1.player_id, a1.event_date;

550. Game Play Analysis IV -> tougher
-- numerator: count # of players logged in for at least 2 consecutive days ,starting from their FIRST login date
-- denominator: total number of players

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT ROUND(SUM(IF(DATEDIFF(event_date, first_login) = 1, 1, 0)) / COUNT(DISTINCT player_id),2) AS fraction
FROM (SELECT player_id, event_date, 
      MIN(event_date) OVER(PARTITION BY player_id) AS first_login
      FROM Activity) AS subquery

A*570. Managers with at Least 5 Direct Reports -> not too bad
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT e2.Name
FROM Employee e1 JOIN Employee e2 ON e1.ManagerId = e2.Id
GROUP BY e1.ManagerId
HAVING COUNT(e1.ManagerId) >= 5 

574. Winning Candidate => If you want to COUNT, you need to GROUP BY usually
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT Name
FROM Candidate JOIN (SELECT Candidateid
                     FROM Vote
                     GROUP BY CandidateId
                     ORDER BY COUNT(CandidateId) DESC
                     LIMIT 1) AS winner
WHERE Candidate.id = winner.Candidateid;

-- This works too => JOIN ON or JOIN WHERE is similar except, 
SELECT Name
FROM Candidate JOIN (SELECT Candidateid
                     FROM Vote
                     GROUP BY CandidateId
                     ORDER BY COUNT(CandidateId) DESC
                     LIMIT 1) AS winner ON winner.CandidateId = Candidate.id 

This answer didn't work -> RANK OVER(ORDER BY COUNT) gives every COUNT 1... doesn't work because when you GROUP BY, each COUNT gives only 1... have to GROUP BY candidateId
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT DISTINCT Name
FROM (SELECT *,
      RANK() OVER(ORDER BY COUNT(CandidateId) DESC) AS count_rank
      FROM Vote JOIN Candidate USING (id)
      ) AS subquery
WHERE subquery.count_rank = 1;

-- winner is the most count in CandidateId from Vote table

-- This answer works
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT Name
FROM Candidate
WHERE id =  (SELECT CandidateId
             FROM Vote
             GROUP BY CandidateId
             ORDER BY COUNT(CandidateId) DESC
             LIMIT 1);

SELECT  question_id AS survey_log
FROM survey_log
GROUP BY question_id
ORDER BY IFNULL(COUNT(answer_id) / COUNT(IF(action = 'show', 1, 0)), 0) DESC

580. Count Student Number in Departments -> flashed 
# Write your MySQL query statement below
# print dept name and number of students majoring in each dep for all dep in dept table (even ones with no current students)
# sort by number of students DESC, sort by dep't alphabetically

                   GROUP BY TIV_2015
                   HAVING COUNT(TIV_2015) > 1)
AND CONCAT (LAT, LON) IN (SELECT CONCAT (LAT, LON)
                          FROM insurance
                          GROUP BY LAT, LON
                          HAVING COUNT(*) = 1);

FROM follow
GROUP BY followee
HAVING followee IN (SELECT follower
                    FROM follow)
ORDER BY followee;

A*626. Exchange Seats -> the CASE ordering has to be below probably because it depends if last id is odd...
=> CASE solution
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT (CASE
            WHEN id % 2 != 0 AND id != last_id THEN id + 1
            WHEN id % 2 != 0 AND id = last_id THEN id
            ELSE id - 1
        END) AS id, student
FROM seat, (SELECT MAX(id) AS last_id

ORDER BY id ASC;
#if id is odd, + 1 to even
#if id is even, -1 to odd
#if id = last id, leave
